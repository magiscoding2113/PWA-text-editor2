# PWA-text-editor2

## Description

This project was created to provide a place where people can add random notes and edit them. It helps eliminate having multiple note pads and allows all notes to be organized in one place. I learned how to use PWA and take what I have learned using webpacks and apply them to complete this assignment. Here is a link to this project in GitHub: https://github.com/magiscoding2113/PWA-text-editor2 and you can see it deployed on Heroku: https://pwa-text2113.herokuapp.com/

## Installation
npm I IDB is required to run this project. 

## Usage

NPM I IDB in your local terminal, then npm I and browser will load and show text editor. You can then install to your nav bar.
